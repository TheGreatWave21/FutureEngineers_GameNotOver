This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2022.

## Directories

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

# The car

Our robot consists of two main parts. The electronics and the chassis. The electronics include the brain of the car, which is the Arduino Potenta and the Arducam, which it could not work without. The Eletrical motors are also part of the electronic system, as well as the steering of the car. Battery is also included. The chassis part of the car includes the Wheels and the mechanic way of turning the wheels.    --to be continued

## Components

This list contains all the materials that were used to build our Robot. This includes everything (except 3D-printed parts, which are not included here. More about them later):
1. Arduino Potenta H7
2. Gens ace Modellbau-Akkupack (LiPo) 11.1 V 1200 mAh Zellen-Zahl: 3 25 C Block
3. Motraxx SR540SH-6230S-67 Universal Brushed Elektromotor
4. Cytron MD10C
5. Arducam 5MP Plus OV 5642 Mini Cam

# Documentation

As a team, we first thought of how to structure the car in a way, that is easy to then drive with. The length x width x height of the car couldnÂ´t exceed more than

You can see the base in the 3D printer.

You can see the unfinished base without the "sticks", which are going to give stability to the whole vehicle and hold our control system. (arduino potenta)

Here you can see the robot in the 3D printing design software. This part will only be used for the base.
